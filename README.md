I have configured the UI for a vending machine used in the laboratory on a Raspberry Pi 4. 

To install PyQt5, you can simply enter "sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5 qttools5-dev-tools" in the terminal. 


- Each label is accompanied by the names of the laboratory members.
- pushButton1 to pushButton_11 are "Purchase" buttons.
- pushButton1_1 to pushButton10_2 are "Cancel" buttons. 
- Each spinbox displays the current balance of each individual. 
- The save button is used to save the balances in the spinboxes.
